# ECB Guide Analysis with ChatGPT

Welcome to the repository dedicated to analyzing the ECB Guide on Models! Here's what this repository can do for you:

## Features

1. **PDF Conversion to Pandas DataFrame**:
   - This tool allows users to easily convert the ECB Guide on Models, which is in PDF format, into a structured Pandas DataFrame. This helps in efficient data analysis, filtering, and querying.

2. **Automated Questions & Analysis**:
   - The repository contains a unique feature that runs a set of predefined questions on the converted dataset. After the questions are run, the tool automatically compares the line in the dataset that is expected to be the best answer against the actual answer provided by ChatGPT.
